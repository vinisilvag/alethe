Beyond veriT: Towards a Generic SMT Proof Format (Extended Abstract)

The first iteration of the proof format used by veriT was presented ten
years ago at the first PxTP workshop in 2011.  Since then the format
has matured, and proofs generated by veriT are used withing multiple
applications.  Indeed, it is quickly growing beyond the confinements
of one singular prover.  We review the challenges we encountered with
using the format in practice, and also discuss the likely problems that
will arise when another solver will use the format.  We also present
our work on a specification for the format.
